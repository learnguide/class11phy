Explain this common observation clearly: If you look out of the window of a fast moving train, the nearby trees, houses etc. seem to move rapidly in a direction opposite 10 ","to the train's motion, but the distant objects (hill tops, the Moon, the stars etc.) seem to be stationary. (In fact, since you are aware that you are moving, these distant objects seem to move with you). Ans. Line of sight is defined as an imaginary line joining an object and an observer's eye. When we observe nearby stationary objects such as trees, houses, etc. while sitting in a moving train, they appear to move rapidly in the opposite direction because the line of sight changes very rapidly. On the other hand, distant objects such as trees, stars, etc. appear stationary because of the large distance. As a result, the line of sight does not change its direction rapidly. 17. Precise measurements of physical quantities are a need of science. For example, to ascertain the speed of an aircraft, one must have an accurate method to find its positions at closely separated instants of time. This was the actual motivation behind the discovery of radar in World War II. Think of different examples in modern science where precise measurements of length, time, mass etc. are needed. Also, wherever you can, give a quantitative idea of the precision needed. Ans. It is indeed very true that precise measurements of physical quantities are essential for the development of science. For example, ultra-shot laser pulses (time interval s) are used to measure time intervals in several physical and chemical processes. X-ray spectroscopy is used to determine the inter-atomic separation or inter-planer spacing. The development of mass spectrometer makes it possible to measure the mass of atoms precisely. 18.

What is the distance of the enemy submarine? (Speed of sound in water = 1450 ). Ans. Let the distance between the ship and the enemy submarine be . Speed of sound in water = 1450 m/s Time lag between transmission and reception of Sonar waves = 77 s In this time lag, sound waves travel a distance which is twice the distance between the ship and the submarine (2 S ).

Is it correct to say from the graph that the particle moves in a straight line for t < 0 and on a parabolic path for t > 0? If not, suggest a suitable physical context for this graph. Ans. No The x -t graph of a particle moving in a straight line for t < 0 and on a parabolic path for t >0 cannot be shown as the given graph. This is because, the given particle does not follow the trajectory of path followed by the particle as t = 0, x = 0. A physical situation that resembles the above graph is of a freely falling body held for sometime at a height. 15.

Interval 3 (Greatest), Interval 2 (Least) Positive (Intervals 1 & 2), Negative (Interval 3) The average speed of a particle shown in the x -t graph is obtained from the slope of the graph in a particular interval of time. It is clear from the graph that the slope is maximum and minimum restively in intervals 3 and 2 respectively. Therefore, the average speed of the particle is the greatest in interval 3 and is the least in interval 2. The sign of average velocity is positive in both intervals 1 and 2 as the slope is positive in these intervals. However, it is negative in interval 3 because the 12 ","slope is negative in this interval. 17.

If the lift starts moving up with a uniform speed of 5 m/s and the boy again throws the ball up with the maximum speed he can, how long does the ball take to return to his hands? Ans. Initial velocity of the ball, u = 49 m/s Acceleration, a = Case I: When the lift was stationary, the boy throws the ball. Taking upward motion of the ball, Final velocity, v of the ball becomes zero at the highest point. From first equation of motion, time of ascent ( t ) is given as: But, the time of ascent is equal to the time of descent. Hence, the total time taken by the ball to return to the boy's hand = 5 + 5 = 10 s. Case II: The lift was moving up with a uniform velocity of 5 m/s. In this case, the relative velocity of the ball with respect to the boy remains the same i.e., 49 m/s. Therefore, in this case also, the ball will return back to the boy's hand after 10 s. 13 ","18.

Read each statement below carefully and state with reasons and examples, if it is true or false; A particle in one-dimensional motion (a) with zero speed at an instant may have non-zero acceleration at that instant (b) with zero speed may have non-zero velocity, (c) with constant speed must have zero acceleration, (d) with positive value of acceleration must be speeding up. Ans. (a) True (b) False (c) True (d) False Explanation: (a) When an object is thrown vertically up in the air, its speed becomes zero at maximum height. However, it has acceleration equal to the acceleration due to gravity (g) that acts in the downward direction at that point. 26 ","(b) Speed is the magnitude of velocity. When speed is zero, the magnitude of velocity along with the velocity is zero. (c) A car moving on a straight highway with constant speed will have constant velocity. Since acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity, acceleration of the car is also zero. (d) This statement is false in the situation when acceleration is positive and velocity is negative at the instant time taken as origin. Then, for all the time before velocity becomes zero, there is slowing down of the particle. Such a case happens when a particle is projected upwards. This statement is true when both velocity and acceleration are positive, at the instant time taken as origin. Such a case happens when a particle is moving with positive acceleration or falling vertically downwards from a height. 13. Suggest a suitable physical situation for each of the following graphs (Fig 3.22): (a) (b) (c) 27 ","Ans. (a) The given x-t graph shows that initially a body was at rest. Then, its velocity increases with time and attains an instantaneous constant value. The velocity then reduces to zero with an increase in time. Then, its velocity increases with time in the opposite direction and acquires a constant value. A similar physical situation arises when a football (initially kept at rest) is kicked and gets rebound from a rigid wall so that its speed gets reduced. Then, it passes from the player who has kicked it and ultimately gets stopped after sometime. (b) In the given v -tgraph, the sign of velocity changes and its magnitude decreases with a passage of time. A similar situation arises when a ball is dropped on the hard floor from a height. It strikes the floor with some velocity and upon rebound, its velocity decreases by a factor. This continues till the velocity of the ball eventually becomes zero. (c) The given a -t graph reveals that initially the body is moving with a certain uniform velocity. Its acceleration increases for a short interval of time, which again drops to zero. This indicates that the body again starts moving with the same constant velocity. A similar physical situation arises when a hammer moving with a uniform velocity strikes a nail. 14.

Ans. (a) A lives closer to school than B. (b) A starts from school earlier than B. (c) B walks faster than A. (d) A and B reach home at the same time. (e) B overtakes A once on the road. Explanation: (a) In the given x -t graph, it can be observed that distance OP < OQ. Hence, the distance of school from the A's home is less than that from B's home. (b) In the given graph, it can be observed that for x = 0, t = 0 for A , whereas for x = 0, t has some finite value for B . Thus, A starts his journey from school earlier than B . (c) In the given x -t graph, it can be observed that the slope of B is greater than that of A . Since the slope of the x -t graph gives the speed, a greater slope means that the speed of B is greater than the speed A . (d) It is clear from the given graph that both A and B reach their respective homes at the same time. (e) B moves later than A and his/her speed is greater than that of A. From the graph, it is clear that B overtakes A only once on the road. 29 ","CBSE Class 11 physics Important Questions Chapter 3 Motion in A Straight Line 4 Marks Questions 1. On a two-lane road, car A is travelling with a speed of . Two cars B and C approach car A in opposite directions with a speed of each. At a certain instant, when the distance AB is equal to AC, both being 1 km, B decides to overtake A before C does. What minimum acceleration of car B is required to avoid an accident? Ans. Velocity of car A, = 36 km/h = 10 m/s Velocity of car B, = 54 km/h = 15 m/s Velocity of car C, = 54 km/h = 15 m/s Relative velocity of car B with respect to car A, = 5 m/s Relative velocity of car C with respect to car A, = 15 + 10 = 25 m/s At a certain instance, both cars B and C are at the same distance from car A i.e., s = 1 km = 1000 m Time taken ( t ) by car C to cover 1000 m = 30 ","Hence, to avoid an accident, car B must cover the same distance in a maximum of 40 s. From second equation of motion, minimum acceleration ( a ) produced by car B can be obtained as: 2. Explain clearly, with examples, the distinction between: (a) magnitude of displacement (sometimes called distance) over an interval of time, and the total length of path covered by a particle over the same interval; (b) magnitude of average velocity over an interval of time, and the average speed over the same interval. [Average speed of a particle over an interval of time is defined as the total path length divided by the time interval]. Show in both (a) and (b) that the second quantity is either greater than or equal to the first. When is the equality sign true? [For simplicity, consider one-dimensional motion only]. Ans. (a) The magnitude of displacement over an interval of time is the shortest distance (which is a straight line) between the initial and final positions of the particle. The total path length of a particle is the actual path length covered by the particle in a given interval of time. For example, suppose a particle moves from point A to point B and then, comes back to a point, C taking a total time t , as shown below. Then, the magnitude of displacement of the particle = AC. 31 ","Whereas, total path length = AB + BC It is also important to note that the magnitude of displacement can never be greater than the total path length. However, in some cases, both quantities are equal to each other. (b) Magnitude of average velocity= For the given particle, Average velocity= Average speed= Since (AB + BC) > AC, average speed is greater than the magnitude of average velocity. The two quantities will be equal if the particle continues to move along a straight line. 3. Figure 3.23 gives the x-t plot of a particle executing one-dimensional simple harmonic motion. (You will learn about this motion in more detail in Chapter14). Give the signs of position, velocity and acceleration variables of the particle at t = 0.3 s, 1.2 s, - 1.2 s. Ans. Negative, Negative, Positive (at t = 0.3 s) Positive, Positive, Negative (at t = 1.2 s) Negative, Positive, Positive (at t = -1.2 s) 32 ","For simple harmonic motion (SHM) of a particle, acceleration ( a ) is given by the relation: a = angular frequency … (i) t = 0.3 s In this time interval, x is negative. Thus, the slope of the x-t plot will also be negative. Therefore, both position and velocity are negative. However, using equation (i), acceleration of the particle will be positive. t = 1.2 s In this time interval, x is positive. Thus, the slope of the x -t plot will also be positive. Therefore, both position and velocity are positive. However, using equation (i), acceleration of the particle comes to be negative. t = - 1.2 s In this time interval, x is negative. Thus, the slope of the x -t plot will also be negative. Since both x and t are negative, the velocity comes to be positive. From equation (i), it can be inferred that the acceleration of the particle will be positive. 4.

(b) speed of the child running opposite to the direction of motion of the belt ? (c) time taken by the child in (a) and (b) ? Which of the Ans.s alter if motion is viewed by one of the parents? 33 ","(Fig: 3 Ans. (a) Speed of the belt, = 4 km/h Speed of the boy, = 9 km/h Since the boy is running in the same direction of the motion of the belt, his speed (as observed by the stationary observer) can be obtained as: = 9 + 4 = 13 km/h (b) Since the boy is running in the direction opposite to the direction of the motion of the belt, his speed (as observed by the stationary observer) can be obtained as: = 5 km/h (c) Distance between the child's parents = 50 m As both parents are standing on the moving belt, the speed of the child in either direction as observed by the parents will remain the same i.e., 9 km/h = 2.5 m/s. Hence, the time taken by the child to move towards one of his parents is . (d) If the motion is viewed by any one of the parents, Ans.s obtained in (a) and (b) get altered. This is because the child and his parents are standing on the same belt and hence, are equally affected by the motion of the belt. Therefore, for both parents (irrespective of the direction of motion) the speed of the child remains the same i.e., 9 km/h. For this reason, it can be concluded that the time taken by the child to reach any one of his parents remains unaltered. 34 ","5.

In the given case, it is given by the slope of the speed-time graph within the given interval of time. Since the slope of the given speed-time graph is maximum in interval 2, average acceleration will be the greatest in this interval. Height of the curve from the time-axis gives the average speed of the particle. It is clear that the height is the greatest in interval 3. Hence, average speed of the particle is the greatest in interval 3. In interval 1 : The slope of the speed-time graph is positive. Hence, acceleration is positive. Similarly, the speed of the particle is positive in this interval. In interval 2 : The slope of the speed-time graph is negative. Hence, acceleration is negative in this interval. However, speed is positive because it is a scalar quantity. In interval 3 : The slope of the speed-time graph is zero. Hence, acceleration is zero in this interval. However, here the particle acquires some uniform speed. It is positive in this interval. Points A, B, C, and D are all parallel to the time-axis. Hence, the slope is zero at these points.

(a) No; (b) No A physical quantity having both magnitude and direction need not be considered a vector. For example, despite having magnitude and direction, current is a scalar quantity. The essential requirement for a physical quantity to be considered a vector is that it should follow the law of vector addition. Generally speaking, the rotation of a body about an axis is not a vector quantity as it does not follow the law of vector addition.

Explain why (a) a horse cannot pull a cart and run in empty space, (b) passengers are thrown forward from their seats when a speeding bus stops suddenly, (c) it is easier to pull a lawn mower than to push it, (d) a cricketer moves his hands backwards while holding a catch. Ans.(a) In order to pull a cart, a horse pushes the ground backward with some force. The ground in turn exerts an equal and opposite reaction force upon the feet of the horse. This reaction force causes the horse to move forward. An empty space is devoid of any such reaction force. Therefore, a horse cannot pull a cart and run in empty space. (b) When a speeding bus stops suddenly, the lower portion of a passenger's body, which is in contact with the seat, suddenly comes to rest. However, the upper portion tends to remain in motion (as per the first law of motion). As a result, the passenger's upper body is thrown forward in the direction in which the bus was moving. (c) While pulling a lawn mower, a force at an angle θ is applied on it, as shown in the following figure. The vertical component of this applied force acts upward. This reduces the effective weight of the mower. On the other hand, while pushing a lawn mower, a force at an angle θ is applied on it, as shown in the following figure. 51 ","In this case, the vertical component of the applied force acts in the direction of the weight of the mower. This increases the effective weight of the mower. Since the effective weight of the lawn mower is lesser in the first case, pulling the lawn mower is easier than pushing it. (d) According to Newton's second law of motion, we have the equation of motion: Where, F = Stopping force experienced by the cricketer as he catches the ball m = Mass of the ball Δ t = Time of impact of the ball with the hand It can be inferred from equation ( i ) that the impact force is inversely proportional to the impact time, i.e., Equation ( ii ) shows that the force experienced by the cricketer decreases if the time of impact increases and vice versa. While taking a catch, a cricketer moves his hand backward so as to increase the time of impact (Δ t ). This is turn results in the decrease in the stopping force, thereby preventing the hands of the cricketer from getting hurt. 52 ","5.

Ans. (a) Force on the seventh coin is exerted by the weight of the three coins on its top. Weight of one coin = m g Weight of three coins = 3 m g Hence, the force exerted on the coin by the three coins on its top is 3 m g. This force acts vertically downward. (b) Force on the seventh coin by the eighth coin is because of the weight of the eighth coin and the other two coins (ninth and tenth) on its top. Weight of the eighth coin = m g Weight of the ninth coin = m g Weight of the tenth coin = m g Total weight of these three coins = 3 m g 54 ","Hence, the force exerted on the coin by the eighth coin is 3 m g.

The bob A of a pendulum released from 30° to the vertical hits another bob B of the same mass at rest on a table as shown in Fig. 6.15. How high does the bob A rise after the collision? Neglect the size of the bobs and assume the collision to be elastic. Ans. Bob A will not rise at all In an elastic collision between two equal masses in which one is stationary, while the other is moving with some velocity, the stationary mass acquires the same velocity, while the moving mass immediately comes to rest after collision. In this case, a complete transfer of momentum takes place from the moving mass to the stationary mass. Hence, bob A of mass m , after colliding with bob B of equal mass, will come to rest, while bob B will move with the velocity of bob A at the instant of collision. 14. A trolley of mass 300 kg carrying a sandbag of 25 kg is moving uniformly with a speed of 27 km/h on a frictionless track. After a while, sand starts leaking out of a hole on the floor of the trolley at the rate of 0.05 . What is the speed of the trolley after the entire sand bag is empty? Ans. The sand bag is placed on a trolley that is moving with a uniform speed of 27 km/h. The external forces acting on the system of the sandbag and the trolley is zero. When the sand starts leaking from the bag, there will be no change in the velocity of the trolley. This is because the leaking action does not produce any external force on the system.

(b) Negative In the given case, the direction of force (vertically downward) and displacement (vertically upward) are opposite to each other. Hence, the sign of work done is negative. (c) Negative Since the direction of frictional force is opposite to the direction of motion, the work done by frictional force is negative in this case. (d) Positive 31 ","Here the body is moving on a rough horizontal plane. Frictional force opposes the motion of the body. Therefore, in order to maintain a uniform velocity, a uniform force must be applied to the body. Since the applied force acts in the direction of motion of the body, the work done is positive. (e) Negative The resistive force of air acts in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of the pendulum. Hence, the work done is negative in this case. 6. Underline the correct alternative: (a) When a conservative force does positive work on a body, the potential energy of the body increases/decreases/remains unaltered. (b) Work done by a body against friction always results in a loss of its kinetic/potential energy.

(a) Decreases (b) Kinetic energy (c) External force (d) Total linear momentum Explanation: (a) A conservative force does a positive work on a body when it displaces the body in the direction of force. As a result, the body advances toward the centre of force. It decreases the separation between the two, thereby decreasing the potential energy of the body. 32 ","(b) The work done against the direction of friction reduces the velocity of a body. Hence, there is a loss of kinetic energy of the body. (c) Internal forces, irrespective of their direction, cannot produce any change in the total momentum of a body.

(d) If the potential energy of two billiard balls depends only on the separation distance between their centres, is the collision elastic or inelastic? (Note, we are talking here of potential energy corresponding to the force during collision, not gravitational potential energy). Ans. (a) No In an elastic collision, the total initial kinetic energy of the balls will be equal to the total final kinetic energy of the balls. This kinetic energy is not conserved at the instant the two balls are in contact with each other. In fact, at the time of collision, the kinetic energy of the balls will get converted into potential energy. (b) Yes In an elastic collision, the total linear momentum of the system always remains conserved. (c) No; Yes In an inelastic collision, there is always a loss of kinetic energy, i.e., the total kinetic energy of the billiard balls before collision will always be greater than that after collision. 33 ","The total linear momentum of the system of billiards balls will remain conserved even in the case of an inelastic collision.

Fig. 6.13 Ans. (a) Rocket The burning of the casing of a rocket in flight (due to friction) results in the reduction of the mass of the rocket. According to the conservation of energy: Total Energy(T.E.)= Potential enegry(P.E.)+Kinetic energy(K.E.) The reduction in the rocket's mass causes a drop in the total energy. Therefore, the heat energy required for the burning is obtained from the rocket. 46 ","(b) Gravitational force is a conservative force. Since the work done by a conservative force over a closed path is zero, the work done by the gravitational force over every complete orbit of a comet is zero. (c) When an artificial satellite, orbiting around earth, moves closer to earth, its potential energy decreases because of the reduction in the height. Since the total energy of the system remains constant, the reduction in P.E. results in an increase in K.E. Hence, the velocity of the satellite increases.
